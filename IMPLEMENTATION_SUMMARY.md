## API Endpoints Overview

### Authentication
- User registration, login, and logout
- Password reset and invitation acceptance
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control

### News Management
- CRUD operations for news articles
- Content approval workflow (draft → submitted → approved/rejected)
- Version control with rollback capability
- Scheduled publishing

### NGO Operations
- Stories management with image uploads
- Gallery management for photos and videos
- Donation processing
- Newsletter subscription

### Administration
- User invitation and management
- Content approval and moderation
- System monitoring and reporting

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary with local fallback
- **Email**: Nodemailer
- **Validation**: express-validator
- **Logging**: Winston
- **Security**: Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Documentation**: Swagger UI

## Deployment Options

1. **Traditional Deployment**: Direct server installation
2. **Docker**: Containerized deployment with docker-compose
3. **Cloud Platforms**: Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
4. **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for scaling

## Future Enhancements

5. **Microservice architecture** for scalability
6. **GraphQL API** as an alternative to REST

## Testing Results

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Authentication tests (registration, login, password reset)
- News management tests (CRUD operations, approval workflow)
- Subscription tests (OTP verification, unsubscribe)
- Security tests (XSS protection, rate limiting)
- File upload tests (Cloudinary integration)
- API documentation tests (Swagger endpoints)
